    "In this paper Henderson et al. investigate the impact of increasing aridity on urbanization in Sub-Saharan Africa. In particular, the authors address the questions of i) *whether adverse changes in climate induce a push from rural to urban areas* and ii) *how this within-country migration affects incomes in cities*.  They attribute previous studies' mixed findings to aggregation effects resulting from using national level data and, therefore, use variation at the district and city level. To enable such an analysis the authors constructed a panel data set combining district level census data, fine resolution climate data and **night time lights (NTLs)** between 1960 and 2008.\n",

    "\n",
    "The analysis is framed by a simple model of rural-urban migration where the migration decision depends on potential wages in the rural and urban sectors, respectively. It follows that rising aridity (i.e., a decline in moisture) only draws citizens into the urban sector in the presence of a manufacturing base creating potentially tradeable goods. Otherwise, the urban sector only services the rural sector and there is no competition for labour. The study employs country-level **two-way fixed effects (2FE) regression** to generate reduced form estimates of the net effect of moisture on urbanization growth and city incomes. Importantly, the authors also provide two robustness checks for the underlying causal mechanism (i.e., aridity driving incomes): i) drawing on the Social Conflict Analysis Database, they do not find evidence of conflict driving the results and ii) at the city level, the effect of conflict on incomes is ambiguous, which does not match the data observed. In the face of the dire climate change projections we are confronted with today, the policy insight from this paper is simple: successful spatial and structural adaptation to climate change will critically depend on the capacities of cities. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I replicate the core results presented in the paper by Henderson et al. (2017). In addition, I enrich the author’s analysis by a detailed discussion of the underlying identification strategy under the counterfactual framework. Importantly, I show that the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) is violated through spatial interdependence and, in turn, **introduce a spatially explicit identification and estimate its results**. My analysis offers general support for the findings of Henderson et al. and provide an exploratory use case of a spatially explicit counterfactual model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining notebook is then structured as follows. In the next section, I discuss the literature on climate induced migration, emphasising the interdisciplinarity of the subject (Section 2). Section 3 then introduces the data set as well as the use of NTLs. The analysis is then structured around the two identification strategies. In Section 4, I first discuss the 2FE identification strategy used by the authors and then proceed to reproduce the core results. The final part of Section 4 discusses the robustness checks of the underlying causal mechanism. Section 5 develops the spatially explicit analysis. After explaining the tension between SUTVA and ignorability I use the results from a simulation study to illustrate the feasible identification strategies. I then examine the spatial dependence present in the data and estimate a set of spatial models. Section 6 offers concluding remarks. \n",

    "I now proceed to discuss the measures of urbanization, income, climate data and industrialization that the authors use. While high-quality climate data is readily available at all levels of resolution, the same is not true for demographic and economic data. Still, if available, the large increase in the number of observations can be a strong benefit to the analysis. At the district level, the data set contains census data between 1960 to 2008 and includes 369 districts or 29 countries. The city level analysis spans from 1992 to 2008 and includes 1158 cities and towns in 42 countries.\n",
    "<h3><u>3.1 Urbanization</u></h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Most studies employ **population data** from infrequent national census reports and rely heavily on imputations and interpolations. To avoid this, the study includes countries with at least two available censuses with the relevant information for a complete or nearly complete set of sub-national units, where either district boundaries changed little or common units over time can be defined. The authors digitized data from hardcopy census publications. Of the 32 available countries, Namibia, Congo-Brazzaville and Liberia were dropped due to issues of district definition or census frequency. The 29 remaining countries count between 2 to 5 censuses between 1960 and 2019. For estimation purposes Kenya is treated as two countries before and after the urban redefinition of the 1990s. While extensive, the sample omits several Sub-Saharan countries, most notably Nigeria, the most populous country on the continent. These countries were omitted either because the censuses lacked the required information or printed volumes were unavailable. South Africa was excluded because of Post-Apartheid migration. The district panel is unbalanced and the authors calculate the annualised urban growth as the difference in urban population averaged by length of the intercensal period. Districts vary a lot in size, a topic which is analysed more closely in section 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, high quality **climate data** is much more readily available at the district level. To reflect climatic agricultural potential the authors use precipitation over potential evapotranspiration (PET) (i.e. system supply over system demand) as a moisture index. The precipitation and temperature data is available from the University of Delaware gridded climate data set while PET is estimated using the Thornthwaite method. The district level climate indicator is then the average grid cell value that overlaps with the corresponding sub-national unit where cells that cross the boundary are weighted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sub-national **data on industrialization** is scarce in many census reports - before 1985 this is even true for national level indicators. Henderson et al. draw on the *Oxford Regional Economic Atlas, Africa* (Ady, 1965) which map all industries by type and city location, based on an in-depth analysis from a variety of sources from the late 1950s and early 1960s. From the total 26 industries the authors exclude 10 agricultural processing industries (e.g. brewing, milling) and use the count of different industries as the industrialization indicator. Comparing this index to 2000 IPSUM data on manufacturing, the 1960 industry count still functions as a good proxy. The full 26 industries are used in most robustness checks."

    "(impact of annual climate fluctuations on annual city incomes and implied (possibly short-term) migration)\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the lack of consistently available **data on total city income**, **night time lights (NTLs)** are used as a proxy. NTLs have become a well-established proxy for economic activity at sub-national levels, a comprehensive overview is provided in Donaldson and Storeygard (2016). The relationship between economic growth and NTLs was first formally tested in Henderson et al. (2012) who found a linear relationship between lights and GDP, a result which was later corroborated by Hodler and Raschky (2014). In the present study, the authors use annual average data from 1992 to 2008 using data from the U.S. Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). As is typical in socioeconomic analyses, clouds and rainfall are excluded and only stable light sources are included. City income is then mapped as the sum of the light intensity of every pixel in the outer envelope. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, since traditional **climate indicators** such as the moisture index are not available at such fine resolutions, rainfall is used instead. The data is used from the Rainfall Climatology Version 2, which combines weather station data with satellite information. Each city's hinterland annual average rainfall is then the average of grid-cell values within 30km of the ever-lit area. Since the moisture index split the sample almost evenly, the authors \"calculate average near-city rainfall between 1983 (the first year in the data) and 1991, and split at the sample median\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, for **industrialization** data, the modern and total industry indicators from the 1965 Oxford Regional Economic Atlas are used. As mentioned above, the 2000 IPSUM data on manufacturing validates the indicator as a good proxy for industrialization at later. Still, for robusteness checks\n",
    "\n",
    "The scarcity of local indicators also is also one of the driving forces for the 2FE specification to account for the unobservables. I now turn to the discussion of Henderson et al.'s (2017) underlying identification strategy. Still, the national agricultural share in GDP for 1989-1991 is used for robusteness checks."

    "As already touched upon above, the low level of aggregation provides both challenges and opportunities. In the case of identification, the fine resolution gives us the opportunity to exploit micro-level mechanisms. On the other hand, the scarcity of data implies that we must rely on a few key variables. While new data sources are being developed and operationalized, as we will see in Section 5, careful consideration of the possibilities and limits of identification is only becoming more relevant. Note, the analyses of the effect of adverse climate change on urban growth and city income are clsoely linked and draw on the same model of rural-urban migration. That is why the identification is disucussed for both approaches together.\n",

    "Armed with only two explanatory variables from the model – the annual level of moisture and the 1960s development of industry – the authors set out to analyse the effect of adverse changes in climate on within-district migration. However, the authors exploit several strategies to account for unobservables: firstly, they propose a **growth-specification** which removes district-specific time-invariant effects such as soil quality, centrality, etc. Secondly, the authors combine this with a **country-level 2FE** specification, which accounts for national-time varying conditions driving urban growth, such as definition of urban areas. The proposed baseline specification can be summarised as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Urb_{ijt} = \\beta_0 Moist_{ijt} + \\beta_1 Indust_{ij} + \\beta_2 Indust_{ij} \\times Moist_{ijt} + \\beta_4 Control_{ij} + \\alpha_{jt} + \\varepsilon_{ijt}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where subscripts define district $i$, country $j$ and year $t$. $Urb_{ijt}$ is the annualized growth of the urban population share, $Moist_{ijt}$ is the 3 year smoothed moisture growth and $Indust_{ij}$ is the time-invariant 1960s level of industrialization, interpreted as the likelihood of a district having industry. $Control_{ij}$ includes the two variables distance to coast and initial urban share. Finally, $\\alpha_{jt}$ is the country-time fixed effects and $\\varepsilon_{ijt}$ is the errors clustered by district.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the social science literature, the two-way fixed effects (2FE) regression is an extremely popular tool for accounting for both unit-specific (but time-invariant) and time-specific (but unit-invariant) *unobserved* confounders in a flexible manner. However, as Imai and Kim (2020) illustrate, their application requires careful consideration of the identification assumptions: besides the assumption of additivity and seperability of the unobserved variables, it also critically relies on the linearity of their effects. In addition, Imai and Kim explain that, contrary to popular belief, the 2FE generally fails to be equivalent to the explicitly causal difference-in-difference (DiD) estimator."

    "\n",
    "The most serious challenge to the 2FE specification concerns the industry data. While the presence of industry is supposed to be the key determinant of the effect of a decrease in moisture, we only observe a snapshot from the 1960s level. Hence, the analysis critically relies on the assumption that 1960s levels of industrialization are representative for the whole period. In relation to the 2FE regression, this means that the local industrial development was linear and only influenced by local constants and global pushes. In particular, this neglects the presence of a vast amount of natioanl and sub-national industrialization policies. Neither can the 2FE specification capture the effect of local policies directly related to urban development and migration."

    "statistically significant effect only arises when we control for the heterogeneity in industry. Column 2 includes the indicator *(9 - number of modern industries)*, where 9 is the maximum count observed. As explained in Section 3, modern industries exclude agricultural industries such as milling. Both the change in moisture and the interaction effect are now strongly statistically significant. The specification of industry likelihood allows us to interpret the moisture coefficient as the effect of moisture for the most industrialized: **a one standard deviation decrease in the growth rate of moisture increases the growth rate of the urban share by about 1.5 percent**. Column 3, using the total industry indicator, presents a similarly strong point estimate for the most industrialized districts."

    "In Columns 1 and 2 we find that both the effect of log-distance to coast and its moisture interaction are statistically insignificant. Neither do they seem to drive the effect of moisture, since in Column 1 the estimate is extremely similar to the result from Table 2. And once the industry-moisture interaction is dropped, the effect of moisture is again statistically not significant. \n",

    "While this paper – in the line with the literature – focuses on within-district migration, there is the potential that migrants might also move across districts.  For that reason, the authors identified for each district one neighbour and include both its growth in moisture as well as it’s interaction effects. In Column 3, both coefficients are close to zero and statistically insignificant – the estimated effect of moisture remains unchanged again. However, this hypothesis merits closer attention since such spill-over effects can violate SUTVA. That is why we’ll return to this topic again in Section 5, where we’ll see that the choice of neighbour is not innocent and there are indeed spatial effects.\n",

    "Since temperature data is not available at the city level, the analysis of city incomes has to rely on precipitation (rainfall) as its moisture measure. Hence, comparing the behaviour of the two indices is key.  Column 4 replaces the moisture index with the precipitation measure. **We find that the coefficients on precipitation and its interaction with industry are extremely similar to the results for the PET moisture index from Table 2, which strengthens our confidence in the city level analysis.** However, when we also include temperature, the other component of the PET indicator, we see that is dominates the moisture effect. The coefficients related to precipitation cease to be statistically significant and instead we have a statistically significant and strongly positive effect of temperature.\n",

Secondly, due to the large sample size an argument can be made that the potential bias from local policies is averaged out in the sample.\n",

    "For a valid estimation of the treatment effect, the potential outcome model relies on the assumption of Stable Unit Treamtent Variance (**SUTVA**). Albeit there exist different formulations, SUTVA essentially requires that i) *there are no different versions of treatment* and ii) *that units not be affected by the treatment status of other units* (Rubin, 1986). This second condition means that **the presence of spill-over and general equilibrium effects needs to be ruled out by the researcher** (see Cunnigham, 2021). To illustrate this in the context of Henderson et al., consider the DAG below: the causal processes of two units are not connected.\n",

    "<img src=\"material/Spatial_DAG_colour_2.PNG\" alt=\"Error: Should Display spatial DAG colour 1\" title=\"DAG fulfilling SUTVA\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as already hinted at above, in many cases we might find this assumption of no spill-overs hard to defend. Indeed, Tobler's first law of geography asserts that \"everything interacts with everything, but two nearby objects are more likely to do so than two distant objects\". These spatial effects are frequently divided into **spatial dependency** (autocorrelation, spill-overs, etc.) and **spatial non-stationarity** (heterogeneity of effects), but the distinction is not always clear-cut and the two can interact (for more, see Anselin, 1988).\n",
    "\n",
    "A common strategy for maintaining SUTVA is spatially aggregating data (see Imbens and Rubin 2015; Morgan and Winship 2014). While popular, it is evident that this \"non-strategy\" directly undermines the added-value of disaggregated data. Translating this to the present study, the issue is whether districts can really be believed to be independent open economies. While the authors admit that there is considerable cross-country variability, they argue that on average districts are \"large. But as can be seen from the histogram below, the distribution is indeed very skewed - with few enormous districts strongly inflating the average. Indeed, more than half of the districts are smaller than $12.000 \\:km^2$, which roughly corresponds to the size of Northern Ireland or Montenegro. This, however, significantly undermines the plausibility of \"no-spillover effects\". \n",
    "\n",
    "As Kolak and Anselin (2019) point out, this highlights a more fundamental problem - in many disaggregated, spatially-motivated analyses, *SUTVA is incompatible with the dynamics of interest*, namely the interplay of disaggregated communities. For that reason, Kolak and Anselin seek to set the foundation of a **spatially explicit counterfactual framework**, arguing that an \"explicitly spatial perspective of the counterfactual framework considers spatial effects in the structure of the research design and assesses their influence on assignment and on the final treatment effect evaluation\" (p.130). And while they provide few practical guidelines, the authors explain that this \"also requires controlling for violations of the assumption of independence between observations and outcomes, in combination with spatial effects, that is, SD (spillover effects) and SH (different responses in different contexts)\" (p.130). Here Castner et al.'s (2014) insight that, in disaggregated data, there exists a \"fundamental trade-off between SUTVA and ignorability\" (p.9) reveals at least one possible entry point for making the counterfactual spatial: breaking down the distinction between SUTVA and ignorability. Rather than clinging to the SUTVA assumption, the interaction effects need to be carefully examined as part of the identification procedure. Importantly, just like in the traditional case, our believed specification will determine what kind of questions we can ask with the data available.\n",

For the implementation we rely on <span style=\"color:red\"> spatial weights </span> to generate the *spatial lag* of the variable of interest (<span style=\"color:red\"> 8 nearest neighbours is being used</span>). The spatial lag defines \"spatial proximity\" and then captures the bahaviour of a variable in the immediate surroundings of each location. Non-neighbours receive a weight of zero and, hence, the (standardized) weight matrix becomes a \"*local average*\" of the variabe. Moran's *I* indicator then fits a linear trend to approximate this relationship (for further information see Anselin, 1988 and Rey et al., 2020).\n",
